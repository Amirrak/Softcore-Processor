# Softcore-Processor (In Progress)
A 8bits softcore processor designed with VHDL: 
### The softcore is not finished yet, the functionnality bold marcked are not implemented yet 
  - Harvard Architecture
  - Custom 16 bit ISA RISC Architecture (ALU instruction : ADD, INC, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, CMP, __MOV instruction__, and __JUMP instruction__)
  - 4 x 8bits registers
  - Flag Register (Sign, Zero, Carry, Overflow)
  - Instruction cicle with 3 step (Fetch, Decode, Execute)
  - __3 stage pipeline__
